# analyzie_sequence
This program is to analyize biologic sequences

## Why was this project created?
This was a project I started on college, on the programming subject. After that subject ended, and until to this day, I continue to try to make the project better.

## Objectiv
This program is divided in 5 stages (exercises).

1. Analyze a sequence
2. Analyze a set of sequences
3. Align sequences
4. Operation with files containing sequences
5. Visualization


### First Stage
a. Insert a sequence manually
b. Generate a random sequence
c. Show the total of elements on the sequence
d. Show the number of occurrences of a nucleotide, or a sub-sequence, and the respective index
e. Show the frequency of a nucleotide, or a sub-sequence
f. Show the complementary sequence (A to T, G to C)


### Second Stage
a. Insert a sequence
b. Remove a sequence
c. Show the number of occurrences of a nucleotide, or a sub-sequence, and the respective index of one sequence of the list or on the whole list
d. e. Show the frequency of a nucleotide, or a sub-sequence of one sequence of the list or on the whole list
e. Show the complementary 


### Thirst Stage
a. Selete an element of the sequence, replacing for '-'
b. Add a new element '-' in the sequence, in a certain position.
c. Show the Hamming distance bewteen 2 sequences of the same size
d. show the number of matches and mismatches between 2 sequences. If a sequence is smaller then the other, it should be added '-' until the sizes are the same. After that, the program should show the 2 sequences in a certain way: the mathces with lower letters, and the mismatches with upper letters.
e. Align both sequences and save it to a align sequence list


### Fourth Stage
a. Open sequences saved on a file
b. save a sequence, or a list of sequences on a file


### Fifth Stage
a. show in a XY graph, the DNA sequence
b. Show an image with 4 histograms, to show the distribution of each nucleotide
